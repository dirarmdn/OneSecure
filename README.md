# OneSecure

Welcome to the project repository for Project 2: Library-based Application Development.

## Overview

OneSecure is a library-based application developed as part of a college project.

## About This Program

This application is a library-based application, aiming to secure a message or text using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Pixel Value Differencing (PVD) cryptographic encryption methods.

This application allows users to input a text which will then be encrypted using AES method and can also be encrypted using PVD method.

The application is also equipped with a decryption feature that allows users to decrypt messages or texts that have been previously encrypted by AES or PVD methods.

## Features
1. Encrypt Message (AES)
2. Decrypt Message (AES)
3. Encrypt Message (PVD)
4. Decrypt Message (PVD)

## Getting Started

To get started with OneSecure, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dirarmdn/OneSecure.git
   cd onesecure
